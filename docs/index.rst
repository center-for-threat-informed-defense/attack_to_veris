VERIS Mappings to MITRE ATT&CK®
===============================
 
 The `Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) <http://veriscommunity.net/>`_ provides a common language for describing security incidents as a whole, while `MITRE ATT&CK® <https://attack.mitre.org/>`_ provides a common taxonomy for describing detailed adversary behavioral tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Mapping between VERIS and ATT&CK allows people to connect the who, what, and why of cybersecurity incidents captured in VERIS with the when and how of the adversary behavior as described in ATT&CK. The resultant translation empowers defenders to efficiently tie adversary TTPs to their real-world impact by connecting ATT&CK-based threat intel to VERIS-based incident reports, to more fully understand and document cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 This project is created and maintained by the `MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center) <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`_ in futherance of our mission to advance the start of the art and and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded by our `research participants <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attck-integration-into-veris/#RESEARCH-PARTICIPANTS>`_.
